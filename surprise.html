					<div class="Column" id="fat">Hi Ed, <br> I've really enjoyed getting to know you better and better over the past four years. I didn't think I'd meet great friends even after undergrad, but you proved me wrong. Thanks for being a fun travel companion and responsible guy who cleans up after everyone when they puke, lol (though we're getting older and that doesn't happen as much anymore ;) ). I look forward to more bike rides, random 1:1's, and other exciting and adventurous memories in the future. Happy 26th!
